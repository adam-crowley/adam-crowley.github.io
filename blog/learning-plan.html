            <h2>Bootcamp learning plan</h2>
            <p class="main__article-date">31 April 2023</p>
            <hr>
            <h3>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>
            <p>My long term goal is to expand my existing abilities, and to be able to get a job as a front-end developer.</p>
            <h3>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h3>
            <p>My strengths are that I'm consistant and punctual when I'm in a regular routine. My limitations are that my social and communication skills could do with improvement.</p>
            <h3>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h3>
            <p>I think I'll find collaboration / pair-programming challenging at first. But I think this will become easier with ongoing practice.</p>
            <h3>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
            <p>My empathatic listening and communication skills.</p>
            <h3>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h3>
            <p>Just to be able to assist if I'm stuck on a problem for more than 30 minutes, or if I have a general query.</p>
            <h3>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h3>
            <p>That I maintain a healthy mindset, look after my health, and maintain mental focus for the duration of the course. And to ensure that I stick to schedule and solidify the knowledge that I learn each week. I'm also committed to spending up to 60hours learning time each week to keep on top of the course material.</p>

            <h2>Foundations learning plan</h2>
            <p class="main__article-date">7 April 2023</p>
            <hr>
            <h3>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
            <p>
              My goal is initially to develop my technical and personal skills so I can land a position as a junior front-end developer. Long term I want to continuously upskill so I can eventually become an expert. That way I can have more job opportunities and flexibility.
            </p>
            <h3>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h3>
            <p>
              My strengths are that I'm logical, methodical and have good attention to detail. I think these are potentially good skills for problem solving and development. My limitations are that I can have poor discipline and be unfocused, but if I maintain a consistant work schedule I can train myself to have good working habits. Also, I can lack self-confidence to do things I don't already know, which has held me back from making any progress in my career.
            </p>
            <h3>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
            <p>I guess my archilles heel is that my communication/teamwork skills aren't great, because I've spent a lot of time working on my own. So I'd like to hopefully get out of my comfort zone to develop these skills. And also to develop my ability to persist when facing difficulty, instead of just giving up!</p>
            <h3>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme</h3>
            <p>I'm committed to maintaining a consistant work pattern and focus during the week, and to use the weekend to revise and solidify my understanding of new topics. If I'm hitting the wall in making progress for 30 minutes, I'll ask for help from facilitators or my cohort. And I'll try to help other people if I know how to solve something that they're having trouble with.</p>
            <h3>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h3>
            <p>From the facilitation team I'll just need help and guidance if I'm having too much difficulty with a problem or topic. I don't have any outside commitments for the duration of the bootcamp.</p>
