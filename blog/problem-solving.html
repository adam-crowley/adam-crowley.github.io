            <h3>The time I was blocked on a simple problem</h3>
            <p>
            When I was doing the Gradebook challenge, I had a bit of difficulty adding the 'testScores' property to each student object. The exercise description specified that bracket notation would need to be used to solve the challenge, and provided a link to a <a href="https://medium.com/@prufrock123/js-dot-notation-vs-bracket-notation-797c4e34f01d" target="_blank">Medium article</a>. The problem solving technique I used was to read that article, which explained the difference between using object dot and bracket notation. I learned that accessing an objects property by using a variable requires bracket notation. Once I used bracket notation I was able to add the testScores property to each student object and pass that test.
            </p>
            <h3>The time I elegantly solved a problem</h3>
            <p>
            When I did the built-in methods' capitilise challenge, and I had to solve the problem of how to manipulate individual words in a string. I googled 'how to capitilise the first letter of every word in a sentence'. I found a <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-capitalize-words-in-javascript/" target="_blank">Freecodecamp article</a> but it used a for loop, whereas the challenge required the map method. So I researched how to use the map method on <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map" target="_blank">MDN web docs</a>. Once I understood how the map method worked I was able to add the logic from the Freecodecamp article and pass the test.
            </p>
            <h3>How confident I feel using each of these problem-solving techniques/processes:</h3>
            <p><strong>Pseudocode</strong><br>
            I'm pretty confident using pseudocode, and have been using this on each challenge.</p>
            <p><strong>Trying something</strong><br>
            I usually do this if I think I have an idea of how to solve a problem already.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Rubber ducky method</strong><br>
            I haven't tried this method yet so I'm not that confident, but I suspect i'll be consulting the duck for it's wisdom in the near future.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Reading error messages</strong><br>
            This is my first port of call if something isn't working, so I'm fairly confident doing this.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Console.logging</strong><br>
            I'm confident using console.log and use it often to see the value of a variable, array or object.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Googling</strong><br>
            I'm confident using Google and I use this whenever I need to research syntax, or when I'm stuck.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Asking my peers for help</strong><br>
            I haven't done this yet, so I'm not that confident. But I know that I can, when I hit the wall on a problem.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Asking coaches for help</strong><br>
            Same as above!
            </p>
            <p><strong>Improving my process with reflection</strong><br>
            After I solve a problem that I didn't know how to initially, I reflect on the new technique so I can absorb it and use it for future problems.
            </p>
            <h3>A time I was reluctant to ask for help</h3>
            <p>When I was doing the Gradebook challenge, I considered asking for help but I managed to solve the problem on my own. If I had been stuck for longer than 30 minutes I would've sought help.</p>
