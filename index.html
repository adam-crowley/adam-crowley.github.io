        <p>Hi all! my name is Adam, and I live in Auckland. I value having a career that is meaningful and one that I can make progress in and having a skill that I can improve over time. And also having discipline, and to be able to persist through adversity. Although I've never been good at either of those things!</p>

          <h2>The Story of Te Houtaewa</h2>
          <p> Te Houtaewa was the fastest runner of his day and played many pranks on his peoples enemies. One morning his mother wanted kumara for the hangi (earth oven) and asked Te Houtaewa to go to the gardens at Te Kao, a short distance away. He agreed to fetch the kumara and told his mother to prepare the hangi.</p>
