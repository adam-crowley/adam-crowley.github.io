            <h3>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>With ongoing practice writing/talking about myself becomes easier.</li>
              <li>Communication/social abilities can be learned and improved, and are not a fixed state.</li>
              <li>That growth mindset can help me maintain a good attitude when learning things outside of my comfort zone.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>It's important to have defined values in order to be grounded and have a solid foundation when learning new skills or solving difficult problems.</li>
              <li>It's important to have empathy to be able to collaborate and communicate well with the people that you're working with.</li>
              <li>Self-awareness is necessary to be able to live in the present moment and to be able to maintain a healthy mindset.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
            <p>That I'm capable of doing things outside of my comfort zone.</p>
            <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
            <p>Writing or talking about myself is difficult because it's not something I have a lot of practice in. Ditto for listening and looping.</p>
            <h3>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h3>
            <p>Employers now place a high value on interpersonal skills, and these are equally as important as having technical skills.</p>
            <h3>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>
            <p>I think writing and reflecting helps humanise the technical process of learning something new and unfamiliar. Talking about technical or core topics also helps me process and understand the things that I've learnt.</p>
