            <h3>An analogy to describe JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS.</h3>
            <p>
            HTML is like a printed page of a book with just the story. CSS adds unique color, typographical style and layout to the page. JavaScript makes the story able to be interacted with like a popup picture book.
            </p>
            <h3>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life.</h3>
            <p>Control flow describes the way that the computer reads code. Generally it will start reading from the top of a code document and continue down until it reaches the bottom. The control flow is broken up by loops, and when it enters a loop it goes around a set number of times, before returning to a linear flow. This could be thought of like a car journey where you travel straight down a road. Stopping at a traffic light would be a loop, whereby a set of number of lights will change before you get a green light and continue your journey.</p>
            <h3>Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.</h3>
            <p>The DOM is a web browser's interpretation of an HTML document, and it has a tree-like structure that's made up of 'nodes'. An HTML document is static and not able to be modified. The DOM starts out exactly like the HTML document, but it's dynamic, and can be modified by Javascript. For example a section of the page might start off at the top, but Javascript can pull this section out of the DOM, change the content, and place the section elsewhere on the page.</p>
            <h3>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</h3>
            <p>Accessing data from an arrays and objects differ in terms of the syntax used. Object properties are accessed mainly by using dot notation and the name of the property (eg cat.breed = 'pallas cat'). Array items are accessed by using bracket notation and the numbered postion of that item in the array (eg cats[6] = 'pallas cat').</p>
            <h3>Explain what functions are and why they are helpful.</h3>
            <p>A function is a reusable section of code that has a specific action. Because there are a lot of repeating actions in an application, rather than write those multiple lines of code each time, they can just live inside a function and be called whenever needed. This minimises that amount of code that needs to be written, and keeps it clean and easily readable.</p>
